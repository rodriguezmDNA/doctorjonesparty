                <p>Graduation Party at <strong>Nashoba Wines (Cork It Again)</strong></p>
                <p><strong>Location:</strong> 820 4th Street, Davis, CA 95616</p>
                <p><strong>Date:</strong> Thursday, 06/13</p>
                <p><strong>Time:</strong> ~6:00pm/6:30pm - 8:00pm/8:30pm (specifics TBD)</p>
                <p class="note">You are invited to join in celebration with Lily’s family and friends on Thursday 06/13 (the day of the Commencement) at a local wine bar. Guests will be invited to share in the food (provided by the hosts), as well as a limited open bar (wine only). Non-alcholic drinks will also be provided. The location is conveniently located downtown on the corner of 4th & G Street, with walking access to several restaurants and coffee shops (and Lily’s house is a just a few blocks away). This venue was chosen to host the party because Lily has worked there since moving to Davis in 2019 and has become close with the wine bar owner and his family and his partner. The venue, owners, and community really mean a great deal to her and she wants you all to be a part of this space and meet the community as well.</p>
